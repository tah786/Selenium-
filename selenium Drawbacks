Limitations:
Selenium does not support automation testing for desktop applications.
Selenium requires high skill sets in order to automate tests more effectively.
Since Selenium is open source software, you have to rely on community forums to get your technical issues resolved.
We can?t perform automation tests on web services like SOAP or REST using Selenium.
We should know at least one of the supported programming languages to create tests scripts in Selenium WebDriver.
It does not have built-in Object Repository like UTF/QTP to maintain objects/elements in centralized location. However, we can overcome this limitation using Page Object Model.
Selenium does not have any inbuilt reportingcapability; you have to rely on plug-ins like JUnit and TestNG for test reports.
It is not possible to perform testing on images. We need to integrate Selenium with Sikuli for image based testing.
Creating test environment in Selenium takes more time as compared to vendor tools like UFT, RFT, Silk test, etc.
No one is responsible for new features usage; they may or may not work properly.
Selenium does not provide any test tool integration for Test Management.
